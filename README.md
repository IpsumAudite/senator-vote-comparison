# senator-vote-comparison
Python web crawler used to extract vote information from the senate website to compare how senators voted on certain issues.

##TODO:
- [ ] Make variables for senator names and have this be user input
- [ ] Make this a graphical tool where user can pick year, senators to compare, etc
- [ ] Export results to excel rather than printing them to the screen
- [ ] Right now loop is hard coded to go through whatever votes you choose. Make this user input and accept a wider range
